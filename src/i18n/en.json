      "title": "Our Story",
      "content": "War3Map.net was born from a simple reason: a love for Warcraft III. Like many players, we grew up with custom maps — RPG adventures, tower defense games, survival challenges, and countless experimental worlds created by passionate makers. Over the years, we came to realize: Warcraft III is more than just a game. It's a platform where creators build worlds and players experience stories. Yet, many wonderful maps are scattered across different websites, lost in forums, or slowly disappearing. We created War3Map.net to help preserve these creations — and more importantly, to help the community continue creating new worlds."

      "content": "Time flies, but the emotions Warcraft III gave us never fade. Those wonderful worlds born in the map editor, those late nights fighting alongside friends — these form our shared youth memories. We refuse to see these creative and passionate works disappear with time. Therefore, War3Map.net is more than just an archive — it's a home we've built for everyone who loves this land. Here, every preserved map is a tribute to the creators' efforts; every sincere share and discussion continues the vitality of this community. We've only just begun this journey. Its future is in the hands of every one of you who is willing to stay and contribute. Because what truly makes this game eternal is never the code or engine, but the countless yous behind the screen who still hold love. Thank you to everyone who makes this place special."
